Pure Fabrication Description

Introduction
Pure Fabrication is a software design principle that focuses on the separation of concerns by assigning responsibilities to artificial classes that do not represent real-world problem domain concepts. This pattern helps in achieving high cohesion and low coupling, ensuring that classes have well-defined purposes and minimal dependencies on each other.
In object-oriented design, Pure Fabrication is useful when a responsibility needs to be handled but doesn't logically belong to any existing problem domain class. By creating an artificial class to handle such responsibilities, the overall system design becomes more modular and easier to maintain or reuse.

Conclusion
The Pure Fabrication pattern introduces artificial classes that promote separation of concerns and enhance software design by keeping domain classes focused on their specific responsibilities. This approach improves system maintainability, allows for easy modification, and promotes reuse by encapsulating distinct tasks into their own dedicated classes.
